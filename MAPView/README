building:
=========

This uses SFML v1.6. in order to compile you will need that

http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/
^ see the 'Getting started' section

editing boat model:
===================

you should only need to edit main.cpp, and maybe consts.hpp

there are two sections in the main function of main.cpp that you need to edit in order to modify the included boat model. the 'setup' and 'loop' sections

Use the included code as a guide. simulation of distance sensors is currently implemented.
